# Welcome to The Cozy Lobby!

This project is a fork of [Twodays Crossing](https://github.com/earthstar-project/twodays-crossing).

## Things you can Do

To run this as a local server on your own computer, clone this repository and run "yarn start". (If you don't have yarn go [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) first).

There's nowhere to test this out yet on the web, but when there is I'll link it here!
